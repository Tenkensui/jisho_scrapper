# jisho_scrapper

**Project status:** Ongoing

Scrapper for the Jisho webpage, a japanese dictionary.

This is an ongoing project, that scraps words of a given search (for example #jlpt-n5), and afterwards create an Anki template for these words. Therefore, this project is for **academic purposes**, aimed to help learning japanese. 

I highly encourage the use of the online Jisho dictionary for reference.
